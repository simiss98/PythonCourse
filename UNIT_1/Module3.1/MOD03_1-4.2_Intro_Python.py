#Task1

x = 9 + 4
# [ ] create a test to print() True or False for x is equal to 13

#Task2
x = 3

# [ ] create an if/else statement that tests if y is greater than or equal x + x
if y>=x+x:
    print(y," y is greater or equal to: ",x+x)
else:
    print(y," y is not greater or equal to: ",x+x)
# [ ] print output: "y greater than or equal x + x is" True/False ...or a similar output
