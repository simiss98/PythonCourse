Task1
#creating x,y and z integer variables and then adding then calculating sum of 3 integers.
x=1
y=2
z=3
x+y+z
# displaying sum of float and integer.
65.7+4
#creating string name variable and then using print just for fun to display both strings.

#creating sm_number and big_number as integers, then displaying sum of those variables.

#Task2
#adding additional string to the variable new_msg and then printing variable new_msg.

#fixing the variable: total_cost in order to print total_cost.

#Hypothesis - When printing float+integer the outome is printed as float variable.

#Task4
# Opening and closing quotes must be the same in order to print a string, e.g 'text' and "text".

#print command is case sensitive for printing variables, we must pay extra attention when typing varianles name inside ().
